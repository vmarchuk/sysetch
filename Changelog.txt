# 1.0
- <runas> block bug fixed, was not working as intended in post mode
- added source.d/ for ability to have multiple source repositories
  for example: use main source for generic, assign env_prod, env_test,
  env_perf, etc... duties to different types of host to create a degree of
  seperation between different environment teams
