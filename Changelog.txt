# 1.1
rsync:
 - added 'background' option to allow rsync to continue in background
 - added 'refresh' option to allow rsync to only try every $refresh
   seconds
 - cleaned up output from <exec> to be more inline with rest of display
 - minor display fixes
# 1.0.3
Modified HOSTNAME to be fqdn.
Fixed LINUXDISTRO to properly display
removed LINUXDISTROVERSION as tracking that is a slippery slope, if someone
needs this info they can always create a hook and add a custom duty
# 1.0.2
- Added ::DEFAULT:: configuration value. This will be used as a placeholder to
represent default options, ie: <rsync options="::DEFAULT:: --numeric-ids"/>
will append numeric-ids to default rsync options instead of previous behavior
of overwriting default rsync options. 
NOTE: currently only works for rsync
# 1.0.1a
- Bugfix where etch would not create initial logs directory
# 1.0.1
- Bugfix where etchpush would not show proper usage output
# 1.0
- <runas> block bug fixed, was not working as intended in post mode
- added source.d/ for ability to have multiple source repositories
  for example: use main source for generic, assign env_prod, env_test,
  env_perf, etc... duties to different types of host to create a degree of
  seperation between different environment teams
